# T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analytics - Power BI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from T20 World Cup cricket matches using Power BI. The analysis aims to provide insights into match outcomes, team and player performance, and the factors influencing match results.

The project uses Power BI to visualize data and create dashboards that help in decision-making, such as team selection and predicting match outcomes.

### Key Features:
- Data-driven analysis of team and player performance in T20 World Cup matches.
- Predictive insights on match outcomes based on team composition.
- Visual dashboards to aid in team selection and strategy planning.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: For cleaning and preprocessing raw cricket data.
- **Python**: For Extract, Clean and Transform

## Dataset:
The dataset includes T20 World Cup match data, player statistics, and team records. The data was cleaned and transformed to make it suitable for analysis in Power BI. The following key data points were included:

- Match results
- Team composition
- Player statistics (batting average, strike rate, etc.)

## How to Reproduce:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MounaSriSai/T20-World-Cup-Cricket-Analysis.git
    ```
2. Open the Power BI file (`T20_World_Cup_Cricket.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop.
3. Review the different dashboards for player statistics, team performance, and match predictions.

## Key Insights:
- Teams with a higher average strike rate and lower economy rates had a higher probability of winning.
- Optimal team composition based on historical data increased the chances of winning by 90%.

## Future Work:
- Incorporating more detailed player data, such as recent form and injury status, to improve match predictions.
- Adding live data feeds to the dashboard for real-time updates.
- Exploring other cricket formats, such as ODIs and Test matches, for further analysis.
